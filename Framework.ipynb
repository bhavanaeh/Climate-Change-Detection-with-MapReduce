        "Cumulative sum methods are used to detect the slow and drastic changes in the mean value of a quantity of interest. This method is used in many application it includes monitor the changes in the production environment, disease expectation, fish populations, deforestation and crime analysis. This paper uses cumulative sum method to monitor the changes in the climate.

        "Cumulative sum method is used to find noticeable shift or change in the average. However, the bootstrap analysis is an additional metric used to determine the significant changes calculated by randomly reordering the original ‘n’ values. This bootstrap analysis is used to verify the changes initially calculated from the cumulative sum value SI. The confidence level is calculated for the bootstrap analysis results. A single bootstrap consists of the following steps:\n",
